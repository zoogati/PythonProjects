Studying IJM0776 - Part of Scenario 2

We can see that the user begins to browse more websites per week around week 29,
but the user began to search for jobs during week 28 (known from keywords).

After about eight weeks of job searching and sending external emails to 
hiring company (week 32), user begins to connect and disconnect a device and
take files. This activity follows the users typical behavior (user disconnects, 
connects, and downloads files constantly). User will do this until they leave 
the company.

User sends a resignation email during week 34, continues to take information,
and leaves the company during week 36.

Will probably look at other users to see if there are any better features.
