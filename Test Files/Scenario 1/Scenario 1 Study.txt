Studying EHD0584 - Part of Scenario 1

We know that the user performed the scenario 1 attack three times, once during week 40, 
once during week 41, and another time during week 42. The attack is will look like the following:

(      2	   ,	  14	     ,   12   ,	       16          ,          4       )
Afterhour logon, device connected, website, device disconnected,  Afterhour logoff

or

(    3       ,       15        ,    12  ,        16          ,       4       )
Weekend logon, device connected, website, device disconnected, Weekend logoff

We also know that the user didn't previously log in afterhours and did not use removable drives.
The user leaves shortly after the attack, so there should not be any activity a few weeks after
the attack. Specifically, the user quits the company on week 45.

Looking at the users afterhour logins, there isn't much of a pattern. On average, the user 
logged in afterhours around 44 times a week, and during the attacks it was 50 and 46. The user,
however, never logged in during the weekend until week 40. Also, the user never connected a
device to the computer until week 40.

Other things to notice are the weekend disconnects, afterhour disconnects, and files being
downloaded and/or uploaded. During the attacks, different types of files are seen to be sent or 
recieved from the internet. These activities never appeared before.
